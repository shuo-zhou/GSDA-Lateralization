# Pre-processing for HCP and GSP resting-state fMRI data

## Data

**Input data** for preprocessing: The original data sets are publicly available at [https://www.humanconnectome.org/](https://www.humanconnectome.org/) for HCP and [https://www.neuroinfo.org/gsp/](https://www.neuroinfo.org/gsp/) for GSP, which can be accessed via data use agreements.

**Output data** from preprocessing: The preprocessed data sets are available at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10050233](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10050233) for HCP and [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10050234](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10050234) for GSP.
