- First-order for left/right classification
- Second-order for male/female classification
- Overlap between first- and second-order coefficients:
  - Sort first-order coefficients by absolute values
  - Sort second-order coefficients by absolute values
  - Take overlap
  - Show first-order coefficients values
- Justification for second-order classification: select gender-related (statistically) coefficients from first-order coefficients
