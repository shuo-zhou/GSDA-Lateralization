- [ ] correlation between univariate models and multivariate models:
  - [ ] univariate control vs multivariate control
        - HCP, r = 0.918, p = 0.0
        - GSP, r = 0.940, p = 0.0
  - [ ] univariate male vs multivariate male
        - HCP, r = 0.472, p = 0.0
        - GSP, r = 0.484, p = 0.0
  - [ ] univariate female vs multivariate female
        - HCP, r = 0.490, p = 0.0
        - GSP, r = 0.505, p = 0.0

- [ ] core results of laterality patterns:
  - [ ] univariate: 并集 - 交集
  - [ ] multivariate: mask generated from second-order coefficients

Remove UK-biobank results

No need to quantify laterality patterns unless there are conclusions to be made about.
